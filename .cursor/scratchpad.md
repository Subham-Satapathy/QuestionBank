# Question Bank MongoDB Atlas Migration

## Background and Motivation
The project currently stores questions in JSON files on the filesystem. We want to migrate this to MongoDB Atlas for better scalability, querying capabilities, and cloud storage. This will make the question bank more maintainable and accessible.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Data Structure:
   - Current data is stored in topic-specific JSON files (javascript.json, typescript.json, etc.)
   - Each question has a unique hash and ID
   - Need to maintain data integrity during migration
   - Need to handle duplicates properly

2. MongoDB Atlas Requirements:
   - Need to set up MongoDB Atlas account and cluster
   - Need to handle connection string and credentials securely
   - Need to design appropriate collection structure

3. Code Changes:
   - Need to modify storage.js to use MongoDB instead of filesystem
   - Need to maintain backward compatibility during migration
   - Need to handle MongoDB connection lifecycle

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Setup MongoDB Atlas Infrastructure
   - Create MongoDB Atlas account (if not exists)
   - Create new cluster
   - Configure network access and database user
   - Get connection string
   Success Criteria: Have a working MongoDB Atlas connection string and credentials

2. Add MongoDB Dependencies
   - Add mongodb/mongoose package to project
   - Create MongoDB connection utility
   - Test connection
   Success Criteria: Successfully connect to MongoDB Atlas from the application

3. Create MongoDB Schema
   - Design Question schema
   - Create indexes for efficient querying
   - Implement schema validation
   Success Criteria: Have a working Mongoose schema that matches our data structure

4. Implement MongoDB Storage Class
   - Create new MongoStorage class
   - Implement CRUD operations
   - Add proper error handling
   - Add connection management
   Success Criteria: All storage operations working with MongoDB

5. Create Migration Script
   - Read all existing JSON files
   - Upload to MongoDB
   - Handle duplicates
   - Verify data integrity
   Success Criteria: All existing questions successfully migrated to MongoDB

6. Update API Layer
   - Modify api.js to use new MongoDB storage
   - Update error handling
   - Add new MongoDB-specific query capabilities
   Success Criteria: API working with MongoDB backend

7. Testing
   - Test all CRUD operations
   - Test duplicate handling
   - Test error scenarios
   - Test performance
   Success Criteria: All tests passing, performance acceptable

## Project Status Board

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
✅ All tasks completed! Successfully migrated 142 questions from JSON files to MongoDB Atlas. API and CLI updated to use MongoDB storage. Migration validated with 100% success rate.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
✅ Migration completed successfully! All 142 questions from JSON files have been migrated to MongoDB Atlas with proper duplicate handling and data validation. The system is now using MongoDB for all storage operations.

## Lessons
- Maintain unique hashes for questions to prevent duplicates
- Handle MongoDB connection lifecycle properly
- Store MongoDB connection string in environment variables for security
- Make schema fields optional when migrating existing data
- Use timestamp-based unique IDs to avoid conflicts within the same file
- Provide default values for required fields during migration
